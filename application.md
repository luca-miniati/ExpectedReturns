## Mentors

Evaluating mentor name and email: Justin Shea (justin.shea@gmail.com)

Co-mentor name(s) and email(s): Eric Gerber (gerber.e@northeastern.edu)

Have you been in touch with the mentors? When and how?

## Coding Plan and Methods

Describe in detail your plan for completing the work.  What functions will be written, how and when
will you do design, how will you verify the results of your coding?  The sub-section headings below
are examples only.  Each project is different, please make your application appropriate to the work
you propose.  

Describe perceived obstacles and challenges, and how you plan to overcome them.

The best R GSoC applications tend to be 10+ pages printed.  Planning is a key part of a successful
project, and demonstrates to the mentors that you are qualified and engaged.

## Timeline

(consult GSOC schedule)

Provide a detailed timeline of how you plan to spend your summer.  Don't leave testing and
documentation for last, as that's almost a guarantee of a failed project. 

Make sure to identify what you plan to accomplish in each month of the project.  Google has asked
organizations to be more directive about milestones. Also be sure to identify what you will
accomplish between acceptance and the official start of coding. (Hint: establishing your build
environment and researching existing work shouldn't wait till project start)

What is your contingency plan for things not going to schedule? We understand things change, but
how are you planning to address changes and setbacks?

If you have other time commitments that will interfere with GSoC, we highly recommend explaining
how you will front-load the work before coding start or work extra early on to build a cushion!

## Management of Coding Project

How do you propose to ensure code is submitted / tested?

How often do you plan to commit?  What changes in commit behavior would indicate a problem?

## Test

The qualification test that I submitted consisted of 4 steps of varying difficulty:

1. Pre-req: Submit a past project written in R
2. Easy: Download/Build code from a past GSoC project
3. Intermediate: Identify bugs in aforementioned project
4. Harder: Analyze the findings of the project
